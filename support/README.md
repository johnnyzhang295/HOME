The sart, taskload, and workload all have different formats. This is because I suck at programming.<br />

SARTScores.csv is a [180 x 1] column vector where rows 1-12 are subject 1, rows 13-25 are subject 2, etc.

workload.csv is a [12 x 15] matrix where column vector 1 is subject 1, column vector 2 is subject 2, etc.

taskload settings.csv is a [15 x 12] matrix where row vector 1 is subject 1, row vector 2 is subject 2, etc.

IF YOU ARE SMARTER THAN ME YOU WILL USE THE FILES IN "HOME/support/raw survey scores"

These all follow the same format: [12 x 15] matrix where column vector is subject data.

<br /><br />
Code written after 12/2/20 should always use the 'raw survey scores' directory because that is the much much much smarter thing to do.
