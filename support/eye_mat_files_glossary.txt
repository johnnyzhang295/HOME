eye_raw_features.mat                              
- This file is contains a subset of pupil_positions.csv,
- This file contains timestamps, diameters, eye_ids, and confidence values,
- pupil_positions.csv is generated as an export file from pupil labs, 
- and has a lot of extraneuos features we don't care about. 
- IMPORTANT: This is all the unfiltered data from the entire experiment period

filtered_pilot_interval_pupil_positions.mat
- This file contains two datasets
- The first column is eye_raw_features but separated by trial and now filtered
- The second column is a partial (see summary table) table of the eye features
- Second col has taskload, workload, median and mean pupil diameters, blink count
- The second column is sort of redundant. Each row is identical to the others.
- IMPORTANT: This is filtered data from a single subject
- IMPORTANT: This is only the piloting interval portion

eye_features_summary_table.mat
- This file contains a summary table divided by trial
- Included are taskload, workload, median and mean pupil diameters, blink count, MPDC, and trial order
- IMPORTANT: MPDC = mean_trial_X / mean_across_all_trials
- IMPORTANT: This is a really dank ass summary table which should be used often
